# VIRTUAL_VOICE_ASSISTANT_PROJECT

This is a virtual voice assistant project built using python language.

The main modules that one needs to download to run this project successfully are-

1. gTTs module (needs internet connection for this module to perform its task i.e., convert text to speech).
2. You need to have "pyaudio" installed in your system to be able to give voice input and make the project recognize your voice input and give its reply as voice output. 
   To download pyaudio visit this link - "https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio" and find PyAudio and download the latest version of PyAudio for your 
   respective OS.
3. Speech Recognition module (converts speech into text).
4. wikipedia module.
5. playsound module.

Rest of the modules comes with the Python package itself. So no need to download.

In this program I have mentioned the path of the microsoft word, miscrosoft powerpoint, microsoft excel, settings and pycharm that is according to my system. 
Please you change this path to the one to which all these softwares are stored in your systems.

You need to include the image "ironmanjarvis.png" in your project folder or else you may get an error while running this project. Since its a GUI based project.
I have also uploaded the image in my repository.

Hope you will like it. If there is any features or any improvements that can be made to this project pls feel free to do that.

Thank you ! :-)
